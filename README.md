==========

Getting to philosophy (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Getting_to_Philosophy).

Install dependencies into a new virtualenv:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run:
`python getting_to_philosophy.py http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_\(philosophy\)`

If your output differs from mine it's probably because of the CSS selector I use to pull the first link of each page. I haven't thought too hard about whether this will be correct for different kinds of pages, but it seems to work ok for a small sample. 
foo
